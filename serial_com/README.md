# Windowns_PSerial
This code provide the form to read and write in serial port of our computer  in windows 10.
is necesary select the correct port (COM#) in wich you device was connected, this code reads bytes 
and its an example of how to comminicate with other device in this specific case a FPGA.

## Ultimate Goals 

* Comunicate two devices at the maximun posible speed
* Auto configure eachother
* generate a file separate by commmas, to add the posibility of do graphs 
* posible correction of errors.

## Current features

* Program reads the manually selected port
* Program can send bytes
